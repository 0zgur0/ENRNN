# ENRNN
Code for the paper "Eigenvalue Normalized Recurrent Neural Networks for Short Term Memory". 

Code was designed for python3 and Tensorflow 1.11.0.  Each problem type is labeled in the file name and requires ENRNN.py to run.

Please be patient, we are in the process of cleaning the code for general use.
